Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library created and released in 2011 intended to create interactive maps on the web.

It is widely used for building interactive and mobile-friendly mapping applications due to its flexibility, ease of use, and extensive plugin ecosystem. Leaflet is often used in conjunction with other web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and various JavaScript frameworks to create powerful mapping solutions for web applications.

Websites that use leaflet include: booking.com, pintrest.com and fiverr.com, weather.com
